This is a Devlog for CrashTV

CrashTV is a 2D pixel art game. It is a mashup of Risk of Rain 1 and the "Invasion RPG" mods for UT2K4

It is currently in very early development. I work on it during my downtime between life and work, so do not expect very frequent updates.

Crash TV is being developed using Godot and C#. I began this project in early 2025 as a hobby project.
